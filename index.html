                <p>
                    I have always been passionate about building things. After completing 
                    degrees in physics and materials engineering I was an industrialization
                    engineer in the automotive and aerospace industries, where I was responsible
                    for the development of new manufacturing processes and the launch of new products.
                    During this time I became interested in the use of statistics and statistical programming
                    for the optimization of material properties during the manufacturing process. This led
                    to an interest in software development and I now work in the aerospace industry on
                    a connected device (IoT) project.
